# Unit 1: Getting started with Java, IntelliJ IDEA, and GitHub

This unit spans the first two chapters of our textbook, _Building Java Programs: a back to basics approach_, and introduces the [IntelliJ IDEA][1] – an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment for Java programming – and [GitHub][2] – an online hub for the [_git_][3] version control system. All of these are professional tools, and the skills of working with them will be good additions to your resume.

## Objectives

After completing this unit you will be able to:

* Describe the structure of a Java program.
* Create a Java _class_.
* Create simple _methods_ with no arguments.
* Declare _variables_ in Java's primitive types.
* Use the System.out.print() and System.out.println() methods to output the values of variables and literals.

These skills will enable you to write relatively simple, but well structured, Java programs which do simple character graphics (ASCII art).
